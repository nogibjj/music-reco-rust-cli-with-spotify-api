# A music recommendation cli tool using Rust with Spotify Developer API 

## Usage

### 1. Obtain a "client id" and a "client secret" from [Spotify developer website](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)

- Learn ways to [generate the access token](https://github.com/mianwu515/rust-world-spr23/tree/main/music-recommendation-service-with-spotify-api#steps) with the client_id and client_secret

### 2. Run the CLI tool with your ready client_id and client_secret
`cargo run -- music --genre [NAME of the GENRE] --id [YOUR ACCOUNT ID] --secret [YOUR ACCOUNT SECRET]`

For example, `cargo run -- music --genre acoustic --id 123456xxx --secret abcdefxxx`
